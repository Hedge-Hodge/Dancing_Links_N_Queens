## Dancing_Links_N_Queens

A general implementation of Donald Knuth's algorithm X with dancing links (Algorithm DLX), built with python 3.8, with a focus on the N Queens problem.

## Installation and Setup Instructions

Clone this repository.

For the main algorithm you will need the following python packages:
`NumPy`
`time`

The main code is contained in the `main.py` file, if you wish to solve the N Queens problem you need only this file, however if you would like to solve your own matrix you must store this matrix in a comma or whitespace seperated file (it is helpful to store it in the same directory as main.py but not required).

Follow the console prompts, either specifying the N value for N Queens or pointing the algorithm to your own file to solve.

Output can be seen in the `main_output.txt` file.

## Reflection

This is a final year project, undertaken by two 4th year mathematical science students at NUI Galway.

The primary goal of this project was to study and understand DLX before implementing it fully in python. This goal has been fully realised.

The secondary goals of this project were to achieve relatively low execution times for the algorithm, allow a user to solve their favourite matrix and to create an illustrative visualisation of DLX in action! These goals have been mostly realised, however there is room for improvement with the execution times (even considering the limitations of python).
