DLX Log

See 'main_output.txt' for the proper algorithm output and aesthetic solution list.
This file contains a detailed record of each iteration of the recursive DLX algorithm.
Each time a new row is chosen, this will be logged here.
Each time the algorithm finds itself in a 'dead end' (i.e. when some of the remaining constraints have size=0) this will be recorded also.
